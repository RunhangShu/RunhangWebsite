*Men are born soft and supple;*

*dead, they are stiff and hard.*

*Plants are born tender and pliant;*
 
*dead, they are brittle and dry.*
 
*Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible*
 
*is a disciple of death.*
 
*Whoever is soft and yielding*
 
*is a disciple of life.*
 
*The hard and stiff will be broken.*
 
*The soft and supple will prevail.*
