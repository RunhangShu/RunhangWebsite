Welcome to my blog. 

\
I earned a Master's degree focusing on host-microbe interactions at the Univ. of Florida at [Wong lab.](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-cn-wong/) in 2021. Then, I was admitted to the [UCI CMB program](https://cmb.uci.edu/), a PhD gateway program. I rotated in three labs and became a PhD candidate in Sep. 2024. In Dr. Albert Siryaporn's lab, I am studying bacteriophages associated with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a bacterial pathogen that causes chronic lung infection. My PhD thesis committee includes Dr. Katrine Whiteson, Dr. Travis Wiles, and Dr. Chang Liu. 


**Research interests**

***Microbiome and host epigenome*** 
Microbes and humans share very similar language in epigenetic modifications. Besides, many microbiome-derived metabolites are involved in the biological process of epigenetic programming. The role of cross-kingdom communication in driving many diseases including cancer has been unfolding. I am interested in apply computational tools to identify microbiome-associated links between epigenetic markers and diseases. These epigenetic markers and microbiome signatures provide early cancer diagnosis and potential microbiome-based treatments. 

***Gut-brain axis?*** 
Have you heard about "We are what we eat?". I believe increasing consciousness about gut microbiome health among the public has been established thanks to the Human Microbiome Project in the early 2010s. Science has shown that what we eat is shaping the little creatures inhabiting our gut. But can these microbes modulate our nutrient preference in return? While dietary preference is dominantly driven by culture and habits, ample evidence shows that gut microbes can change food decisions in fruit flies (Adam Wong lab). I am interested in studying how certain microbes drive animals' craving for sugar, with the ultimate goal to help humans have less of a resistance to eating healthy. 

***Phage DNA packaging***
Phages must package their DNA into procapsids to produce new progeny. But how is this process accomplished with such precision, where the phage "knows" which DNA is its own and avoids packaging the wrong sequences?

**Advocation**

-   "Understanding how microbes affect health and the biosphere requires
    an international initiative" - Nicole Dubilier, Margaret
    McFall-Ngai, and Liping Zhao
-   Transparent datasets and transparent methodology are fundamental for
    the advancement of science.

-   "Science not communicated is science not done" - Mellisa Marshall

We all love science and cherish the fact that this is the greatest time to do
science. Importantly, we should also TALK about science, SHARE ideas,
and keep CRITICIZing.

  Here, I will log my thoughts on general science and my research field. The website will witness my progress and the development of my research philosophy and life philosophy.
